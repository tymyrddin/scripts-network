While the Covid epidemic may have temporarily baffled governments around the world, it has nonetheless disoriented subversive forces. That it is now openly used as a Trojan horse for the worst reactionary impulses as well as for the establishment of new control mechanisms is not surprising, but what is more surprising is the daze from which we ourselves are unable to escape. In this text, Serge Quadruppani, Jérôme Floch and a few others propose to take stock of what has been distracting until now, the false friends as well as the bad oppositions. A humble but salutary attempt to see things clearly.

Macron's creation, for purely electoral reasons, of a new internal enemy in the guise of the "non-vaccinated" is the final stage of a manipulation in which we have all, in one way or another, fallen.
Let us recall that it was this same Macron who, at the time of announcing the first containment, on 12 March 2020, provided evidence of the disarray that was then snaking its way through the world's leaders, when he came to declare: "My dear compatriots, tomorrow we will have to learn the lessons of the moment we are going through, to question the development model in which our world has been engaged for decades and which is revealing its flaws in broad daylight, to question the weaknesses of our democracies. What this pandemic has already revealed is that free health care, regardless of income, background or profession, and our welfare state are not costs or burdens but precious assets, indispensable when fate strikes. What this pandemic reveals is that there are goods and services that must be placed outside the laws of the market. Delegating our food, our protection, our ability to care for our living environment to others is madness.
