# Sniffing

With network sniffers it is possible to see packets entering and exiting a target machine and sniffers have many practical uses before and after exploitation. In some cases, it will be possible to use existing sniffing tools like [Wireshark](https://wireshark.org/) and [Scapy](../scapy/README.md). 

Not always. There is an advantage to be able to quickly build sniffers to view and decode network traffic.
